# Introduction
This project is a scraping tutorial for beginners. We use a structurally simple website, hkcib.org, to demonstrate the basic elements of scraping, namely download, parse, and export.

# Quickstart
Open terminal and type:
```
pip install selenium
```
Selenium is the only external Python package used in this tutorial. It is a framework for developing browser robots, with it you can make a robot to navigate webpages like human.

The second step is to make sure you have a Chrome browser and a Chrome driver installed on your computer. Simply place the Chrome driver in your Python directory.
